# The Scenario

A Windows estate breached on **19 September 2020**:

- Attacker **brute-forces RDP** into a Domain Controller
- Drops **Meterpreter / `coreupdater.exe`**, injects into `spoolsv.exe`
- Beacons to a **C2 in Thailand** (`203.78.103.109:443`)
- Moves laterally **DC → Win10 desktop**, stages and **exfiltrates secrets**
- **Time-stomps a decoy** — and is *still interactive* at the moment of capture

You are the IR analyst. You receive the evidence cold. **Build the story.**

# What We Use Today — and Why

✅ **In scope:** **disk image + RAM dump** for *both* hosts. Nothing else.

This is **not** us simplifying the case. It is us **mimicking real post-incident IR**:

- In a real engagement you almost always get **a dead disk and (if you're lucky) a memory capture** — pulled after the fact.
- Everything else on that download page is a **convenience the CTF pre-cooked for you.** We refuse the convenience on purpose.

> The skill we are training is *working from what you actually get*, not from a tidy artifact bundle.

# Why No PCAP

`case001-pcap.zip` is **excluded** — deliberately.

- Full packet capture means **someone was already recording the wire** before/at the breach. In the field that is **rare** — most orgs have no retained PCAP at the moment that matters.
- Relying on PCAP teaches a habit that **breaks the day you don't have it.**
- The *outcomes* PCAP would show — the brute force, the C2 — are **independently provable** from disk (EVTX 4625/4624) and memory (netstat). We reconstruct them from artifacts that **survive**.

PCAP-only details (an NMAP 3389 probe at 02:19) become a **footnote**, not an assessable question.

# Why We Extract the System Files Ourselves

`*-autorunsc.zip` and `*-ProtectedFiles.zip` are **excluded** — also deliberately.

- Those are **pre-extracted hives, autoruns, locked files** — work a tool already did *in the lab*.
- Pulling `SYSTEM` / `SOFTWARE` / `SAM`, `$MFT`, EVTX, `SRUDB.dat` **out of the E01 by path** is a **core lab step** — so we do it ourselves, live.
- Locked/"protected" files (loaded hives, `pagefile.sys`) can't be copied off a live box normally — but on a **dead image every byte is reachable.** That's the lesson.

> Extraction *is* the exercise. You leave knowing how the sausage is made.

# One Trap to Internalize: The Clock

The victim VMs were **mis-configured to UTC−7**. The (excluded) PCAP router was **UTC−6**.

- Disk / EVTX / memory timestamps read **~1 hour ahead** of the network-clock narration in the official key.
- The key's `02:24:06` download = your tooling's **`03:24:06Z`** — *same instant, different clock.*

**Always establish clock provenance before you trust a timeline.** Issen surfaces this via `ClockProvenance` so the skew is a labeled fact, not a silent error.

# The Real Point of This Workshop

Knowing *which tool* and *where the artifact lives* feels like expertise. It is a **fake moat**:

- It is **mechanical** — lookup-table knowledge.
- In the age of AI it is being **unified, normalized, and automated away.**

The **real moat** is the **investigative mindset**:

- Reading what the output **means**
- Building the **attack narrative**
- **Presenting it** to a board with intellectual honesty

> We spend the *mechanical* time in **one** tool so the *cognitive* time goes where it counts.

# Why Issen Is Different

The traditional path: **FTK Imager + Volatility + Eric Zimmerman tools + KAPE** — four ecosystems, three languages, two OSes, glue scripts in between.

Issen's bet:

- **One cross-platform binary.** Native macOS / Windows / Linux. Rust. `cargo install`, no runtime.
- **One address space for the whole case** — disk, memory, logs converge into a single timeline.
- **Forensically paranoid by construction** — panic-free parsers, never trust a length field, fail loud on the unknown.
- **Findings, not verdicts** — every output is *"consistent with"*, leaving the conclusion to you.

# It's Not One Tool — It's a Fleet

Issen is a thin **orchestration layer** over a family of standalone, single-purpose forensic libraries.

- Each library is a **deep expert** in one artifact family (NTFS, EVTX, SRUM, memory paging…).
- Issen **wires them together** and correlates across them.
- Every library emits the **same normalized finding model**, so one report renders them uniformly.

The architecture is organized around **how an analyst navigates evidence** — five fundamental primitives.

# The Five Navigation Primitives

Every piece of evidence is reached by exactly one of five "navigation verbs":

| | Primitive | You navigate by… |
|---|---|---|
| **[P]** | **Disk** | `name → inode → block` (walk the filesystem tree) |
| **[M]** | **Memory** | `PID → EPROCESS → virtual addr → physical addr` |
| **[L]** | **Log** | `timestamp / record-# → boundary → field` |
| **[Q]** | **Live Query** | `endpoint, query, cursor → result rows` |
| **[C]** | **Content-addressed** | `hash → blob → Merkle graph` |

**Today we live in [P] and [M]** — disk and memory. ([L] logs live *on* the disk; [Q]/[C] are for live and CAS evidence.)

```mermaid

  EV["Evidence"]
  EV --> P["P · Disk<br/>name → inode → block"]

```

# The IR Analyst's Journey

We'll walk the **pipeline in the order you actually meet the evidence** — outside-in:

1. **Container** — the image format on your desk (E01, VMDK…)
2. **Partition table** — where are the volumes?
3. **File system** — NTFS: turn paths into bytes
4. **Filesystem timeline** — `$MFT`, USN journal, `$LogFile`
5. **Event logs** — EVTX
6. **Registry & SRUM** — system state and the usage ledger
7. **Memory** — the live truth the disk can't show
8. **Correlation → narrative → report**

> Each is a *fundamental* — learn it once, recognize it everywhere.

# 1 · Containers — What Lands on Your Desk

You never get "a disk." You get a **container**: a file that wraps the raw sectors.

| Format | Where it comes from | Issen reader |
|---|---|---|
| **E01 / EWF** | FTK Imager, EnCase — the IR standard. Compressed, hashed, segmented (`.E01`, `.E02`…) | `ewf` |
| **VMDK** | VMware virtual disks — half of all "servers" are VMs | `vmdk` |
| **VHD / VHDX** | Hyper-V, Azure | `vhdx` |
| **raw / dd / img** | `dd`, FTK "raw", Linux | `dd` |

**Job of this layer:** hand everything above it **one flat, addressable sector stream** — the container format becomes invisible.

> Our two case files are **E01** sets. Note the segments: `…E01` + `…E02` are *one* image.

```mermaid

# Container Gotchas Worth Knowing

- **E01 is a *set*, not a file.** `image.E01`, `image.E02`, … must travel together — they're one logical disk split for portability. Point the tool at the **first** segment; it finds the rest.
- **E01 carries its own hashes.** Acquisition stored an MD5/SHA. Verify it before you trust a single byte — chain of custody starts here.
- **Compression is transparent.** EWF is zlib-compressed under the hood; the reader inflates on the fly. You address sectors, not compressed blocks.

`issen <first.E01>` opens the container for you — the rest of the pipeline never sees EWF again. And because issen reads **zip / 7z / tar.gz** natively, you can point it straight at the evidence archive you downloaded (`issen DC01-E01.zip`) — it unwraps the archive *and* cracks the split E01 inside, no manual unzip.

```mermaid

# 2 · Partition Tables — Finding the Volumes

A raw sector stream is not yet a filesystem. First: **where do the volumes start?**

- **MBR** (legacy) — 4 primary partitions, 32-bit LBA, the classic `0x55AA` boot signature at offset 510.
- **GPT** (modern) — 128 entries, 64-bit LBA, CRC-protected header, a protective MBR up front.

**What forensics looks for here:**
- Partition **boundaries** (so we mount the right NTFS volume)
- **Overlaps / gaps / hidden partitions** — a classic place to stash data
- A boot signature that **doesn't parse** → surface the raw bytes, don't guess

> The Windows system volume is the one we want — that's where `\Windows\System32` and the hives live.

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 7
  bc["boot code<br/>446 B"]:3
  p1["part #1<br/>16 B"] p2["#2"] p3["#3"] p4["#4"]
  sig["55 AA"]
```

*The 512-byte MBR (above): 4 fixed-size partition entries + the `0x55AA` magic. **GPT** replaces this with a CRC-checked header + a 128-entry table — same job, a different on-disk structure.*

---

# 3 · File Systems — Paths Into Bytes

NTFS is the navigation engine for `[P]`: **`name → inode → block`**.

- Everything is a file — even the metadata. The master record is **`$MFT`**.
- Each file = an MFT record of **attributes**: `$STANDARD_INFORMATION`, `$FILE_NAME`, `$DATA`, `$INDEX`…
- **Resident vs non-resident:** small files live *inside* the MFT record; large files point out to **data runs** (cluster lists).
- **Deleted ≠ gone.** The MFT record and its runs often survive until overwritten — that's how we **carve**.

**Our job:** resolve `C:\Windows\System32\coreupdater.exe` → MFT record → clusters → bytes, with **zero trust** in any length field along the way.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class MFT_RECORD {
    FILE header
    $STANDARD_INFORMATION
    $FILE_NAME
    $DATA
  }
  class RUNLIST { LCN + length pairs }
  MFT_RECORD --> RUNLIST : $DATA non-resident
  RUNLIST --> CLUSTERS : on-disk bytes
```

*Resident `$DATA` holds the bytes **inside** the record; non-resident `$DATA` is a **runlist** of cluster ranges (above).*

---

# The Two Timestamps That Catch Liars

Every NTFS file carries **two** sets of MAC times:

- **`$SI` — `$STANDARD_INFORMATION`** — what Explorer shows. **User-writable** via the Windows API.
- **`$FN` — `$FILE_NAME`** — kernel-maintained, **much harder to forge.**

**Timestomping** rewrites `$SI` to hide when malware really landed. The tell:

> `$SI.modified` **earlier than** `$FN.created` → physically impossible → **manipulation.**

In our case the attacker stomps **`Beth_Secret.txt`**. The `$SI`/`$FN` split is how we prove it — a finding flagged *Info → lead*, because the heuristic has false positives and the analyst confirms.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class MFT_RECORD
  class STANDARD_INFORMATION {
    Created
    Modified
    Accessed
    MFT_Changed
  }
  class FILE_NAME {
    Created
    Modified
    Accessed
    MFT_Changed
  }
  MFT_RECORD --> STANDARD_INFORMATION : $SI user-writable
  MFT_RECORD --> FILE_NAME : $FN kernel-set
```

*Both attributes carry the same four MAC fields. **Timestomp tell:** `$SI.Modified` earlier than `$FN.Created` — physically impossible, so flag it.*

---

# 4 · The Filesystem Timeline — Change History

NTFS journals its own changes. Three artifacts reconstruct *what happened to files, when*:

| Artifact | What it records | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| **`$MFT`** | Current state + `$SI`/`$FN` MAC times | When `coreupdater.exe` first appeared; the timestomp |
| **`$UsnJrnl:$J`** | A rolling log of **every** create / delete / rename / write | `secret.zip`, `loot.zip` **staged and deleted** — even after the file is gone |
| **`$LogFile`** | Transaction log (metadata replay) | Lowest-level corroboration / recovery |

> USN is the hero of exfil hunting: it remembers the `loot.zip` that the attacker **created and then deleted** to cover tracks.

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 5
  a["USN"] b["Reason<br/>CREATE / DELETE / RENAME"] c["TimeStamp"] d["FileName"] e["ParentFRN"]
```

*One `$UsnJrnl:$J` record (above) per change. The journal is an append-only stream of these — so a `loot.zip` `DELETE` record survives even after the file's MFT entry is reused.*

---

# 5 · Event Logs — EVTX (the [L] Path)

Windows event logs are the **[L]og** primitive: seek by **record-id / timestamp → field**.

- Binary **EVTX** format, BinXML-encoded — not text. We decode chunks → typed `EventRecord`.
- Extracted **from the disk** by path: `…\Security.evtx`, `System.evtx`.

**The story lives in a handful of Event IDs:**

| EID | Meaning | In this case |
|---|---|---|
| **4625** | Logon **failure** | The RDP brute-force **flood** |
| **4624** | Logon **success** (type 10 = RDP) | Compromise: `Administrator` from `194.61.24.102` |
| **7045** | **Service installed** | `coreupdater` persistence |
| **4634/4647** | Logoff | Last adversary contact |

> 4625-flood → 4624-success is the *entire entry story*, written down by Windows itself.

# 6 · Registry — On Disk vs In Memory

The registry is **one logical tree** that lives in **two different address spaces** — and you read it differently in each.

- **`[P]` On disk** — the hive **files** (`SYSTEM`, `SOFTWARE`, `SAM`, `NTUSER.DAT`). Extracted from the E01. Gives you **OS version, timezone (the clock truth), services, Run keys, account hashes, per-user activity** — the *persisted* state.
- **`[M]` In memory** — the same hives loaded as **`_CMHIVE`** kernel objects. Gives you **volatile keys with no disk copy, unflushed in-RAM edits, and the registry itself when you have no disk** — the *live* state.

> Same keys, two readers. On disk a cell is a flat file offset; in memory it's a scattered allocation you reach through the **HMAP**.

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 4
  bb["regf base<br/>0x1000"] h1["hbin"] h2["hbin"] cc["nk / vk / sk / lf cells"]
```

*The **on-disk hive file** (above) is one contiguous blob: a `regf` base block then a run of 4 KB `hbin`s holding the cells — so a cell index is a **flat offset** (`0x1000 + index`). In memory those same bins are scattered, and the index must be translated through the HMAP (next).*

---

# Registry in Memory — The HMAP Translation

On disk a hive is one contiguous blob, so a **cell index** is just an offset. In RAM the kernel scatters the hive's 4 KB **bins** across paged pool — so the same cell index must be **translated through the hive map (`HMAP`)**, a page-table-like walk. This is exactly how `issen` reads a hive straight from `citadeldc01.mem`.

The 32-bit cell index decomposes into four fields:

- **bit 31** → Stable (0) vs **Volatile** (1) storage
- **bits 30–21** (`& 0x3FF`) → `_HMAP_DIRECTORY` index → `_HMAP_TABLE*`
- **bits 20–12** (`& 0x1FF`) → `_HMAP_TABLE` index → `_HMAP_ENTRY`
- **bits 11–0** (`& 0xFFF`) → byte offset inside the 4 KB bin

> On **Server 2012 R2 (build 9600 — our DC)** the entry exposes only `BlockAddress`; newer builds add `PermanentBinAddress`. Issen tries the new field, then **falls back to `BlockAddress`** — without it every hive-cell read on the DC fails.

**The cell index (a `u32`) is a packed bit-field:**

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 4
  b31["bit 31<br/>Stable / Volatile"] bd["bits 30-21<br/>dir index (0x3FF)"] bt["bits 20-12<br/>table index (0x1FF)"] bo["bits 11-0<br/>offset (0xFFF)"]
```

**Each field indexes the next level of the hive map — a pointer chase:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class _HMAP_DIRECTORY { Directory[1024] }
  class _HMAP_TABLE { Table[512] }
  class _HMAP_ENTRY { BlockAddress }
  _HMAP_DIRECTORY --> _HMAP_TABLE : dir index (30-21)
  _HMAP_TABLE --> _HMAP_ENTRY : table index (20-12)
  _HMAP_ENTRY --> BIN : 4 KB bin VA
  BIN --> CELL : + offset (11-0), +4 size hdr
```

# SRUM — The Usage Ledger That Outlives Deletion

**SRUM** (`SRUDB.dat`, an ESE database) silently logs per-process resource usage Windows uses for the battery UI:

- **Bytes sent / received per application** — an exfil ledger.
- **Which executables ran, and when** — even after the binary is deleted.

It's an **ESE B-tree** (same engine as Exchange/AD) — a parser job, not a casual read.

> When the attacker deletes the malware, SRUM may still hold *"this process moved N bytes out at time T."* That's how you quantify the theft.

```mermaid

*`SRUDB.dat` is an ESE database: descend the **B-tree** to the leaf pages, each row a `SRUM_RECORD` with the bytes-sent/received ledger that survives the malware's deletion.*

# 7 · Memory — The Live Truth

The disk shows what was **stored**. Memory shows what was **running**. This is the **[M]** primitive.

**`PID → EPROCESS → virtual address → physical address`** — a page-table walk.

- **PAGING (`memf-hw`)** — OS-agnostic hardware: CR3/DTB, PML4 / PAE / AArch64 page walks. Turns a VA into a physical offset in the dump.
- **OS STRUCTURE (`memf-windows`)** — walks the `EPROCESS` list, VAD tree, network tables, credential caches.
- **Symbol-driven:** it resolves the kernel's PDB (GUID-matched, auto-downloaded) so struct offsets are exact for *this* build — not guessed.

> Memory is where the **C2 IP, the live malicious process, and the `spoolsv` injection** live — none of which the disk can show you.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class EPROCESS {
    ImageFileName
    DirectoryTableBase
  }
  EPROCESS --> PML4 : CR3 / DTB
  PML4 --> PDPT
  PDPT --> PD
  PD --> PT
  PT --> PHYS_PAGE : VA to PA
```

*`EPROCESS.DirectoryTableBase` (CR3) roots a **4-level page table** — each virtual address indexes PML4 → PDPT → PD → PT to a physical page in the dump.*

# Auto-Profile — Zero-Config Symbols (vs Volatility 3)

Every offset `memf` reads is exact for **this** kernel build, because it resolves the kernel's own **PDB** — never a hand-picked profile. The chain (`memf-symbols`):

1. **Find the kernel in the dump** — scan physical pages for the `ntoskrnl` / `ntkrnlmp` MZ/PE header, reverse-map the **RSDS CodeView** record to the kernel base (MZ/PE-validated, not guessed). ✅
2. **Read the PDB GUID + age** straight from that CodeView record — a fingerprint unique to one Windows build (this *is* the build identity; no registry `NtBuildNumber` needed).
3. **GUID-match the PDB** — pull `ntkrnlmp.pdb` from the **Microsoft public symbol server**, GUID+age matched, then cache it. ✅
4. **Overlay** the matching struct layout (`EPROCESS`, TCP endpoint, registry `_CM_KEY` offsets…) for that build. ◐ (overlay coverage is per-build WIP)

**Microsoft Windows Server, too.** `citadeldc01` is a Windows **Server** DC — its server kernel resolves through the *same* GUID+age path. There is no separate "server profile": client and server are one code path.

**Symbol-cache interop** — resolved in this order, so you reuse symbols you already have:

1. `$MEMF_SYMBOL_CACHE`
2. `$_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` (WinDbg `srv*DIR*URL` layout)
3. **Volatility's own `CACHE_PATH`** (`~/.cache/volatility3`) — we read Volatility's symbol cache directly.

> **Can Volatility 3 do this?** Vol3 uses pre-built **ISF JSON** symbol tables and its *automagic* to pick one — it does **not** fetch the PDB from Microsoft itself; you build/download the ISF in a separate step. issen GUID-matches and downloads the PDB **inline**, and on top of that reads Vol3's cache.

# What Memory Recovers Here

Walking `citadeldc01.mem` / `DESKTOP-SDN1RPT.mem`:

- **`ps` / process list** — `coreupdater.exe` running, parentage, the migration into `spoolsv.exe`.
- **`netstat`** — the live socket to **`203.78.103.109:443`** (the Thailand C2), reconstructed by scanning TCP endpoint pool tags — *without* the PCAP we threw away.
- **`scan` / malfind** — injected, executable-but-private memory regions (the injection signature).

Mapped to ATT&CK: **T1055** (injection), **T1071/T1573** (C2 over encrypted channel).

> Same instant the brute force succeeded on disk — now corroborated by what's *live in RAM*.

# Credential Extraction — The Full Chain (vs Volatility 3)

Credentials are a **chain**, not a single plugin — every secret descends from the SYSTEM boot key (or a user's password). issen walks the whole chain. **Volatility 3 stops at the registry/LSA layer — it has no DPAPI branch at all** (in the field you fall back to Impacket's `dpapi.py`). On the registry trio, **Vol3 is our oracle**: we cross-check against it, we don't claim to beat it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  BK["SYSTEM<br/>boot key"] --> LSAK["LSA key<br/>(PolEKList)"]
  SAM["SAM"] --> HD["hashdump<br/>→ NTLM"]

  LSAK --> DPS["DPAPI_SYSTEM"] --> MDK["machine DPAPI<br/>master key"]
  MDK --> MACH["Wi-Fi PSK ·<br/>machine CredMan / Vault"]
  LSAK --> LSEC["lsadump → $MACHINE.ACC,<br/>service passwords"]
  UPW["user<br/>password"] --> UDK["user DPAPI<br/>master key"] --> COOK["browser v10/v20<br/>cookie keys"]
```

*`DPAPI_SYSTEM` is itself an **LSA secret** — so `lsadump` is the keystone: it feeds both `NL$KM` (cached creds) and the machine DPAPI master key (Wi-Fi, machine vault). User-context DPAPI (browser cookies) bootstraps from the user's password instead.*

| Stage (artifact) | issen | validation | Vol3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAM NTLM — `hashdump` | RC4 + AES revisions; refuses on unsupported rev | ✅ Tier-2, **Vol3 as oracle** on real DC (Administrator `f56a8399…`) | ✅ plugin |
| LSA secrets — `lsadump` | bootkey → PolEKList → per-secret AES | ✅ Tier-2, **Vol3 as oracle** on real DC | ✅ plugin |
| Cached domain creds — `cachedump` | NL$KM → DCC2; decrypts + refuses | ◐ correct; e2e owed | ✅ plugin |
| DPAPI — cookies / CredMan / Vault / Wi-Fi — `dpapi-forensic` | audited RustCrypto; refuses-don't-fabricate | ✅ vs Impacket vectors | — **no plugin** |

> **Honesty:** ◐ = code correct + refuses-don't-fabricate, real-data e2e owed. DPAPI is validated against Impacket vectors; the machine-DPAPI branch (`DPAPI_SYSTEM → master key → Wi-Fi`) isn't yet wired end-to-end on the case data. **No placeholder crypto anywhere — audited RustCrypto, or it refuses.**

# Part II — The Investigation, Question by Question

We answer the **official DFIR Madness question set** — all 13 + the Advanced/Bonus set — **grouped by the issen command that answers them**, so you master one tool surface at a time. One command builds the whole case (ingest + correlate + scan, one pass); one digs the memory:

```bash
# issen reads the download archive directly — zip / 7z / tar.gz, no manual unzip
issen DC01-E01.zip -o dc01.duckdb        # disk → timeline + correlations + findings
issen memory citadeldc01.mem --command all   # memory → processes, C2, creds
```

> **One thing you still extract:** the **memory dump**. `issen` unwraps the archive,
> cracks the **E01 disk image inside it**, and walks the filesystem — all from the `.zip` you
> downloaded. But the memory walker reads a *raw page stream*, so unzip the memory archive to
> `citadeldc01.mem` first. Everything disk-side ingests the `.zip` as-is.

Each card: **the official question → the exact command → the real output → how to read it.** Drill-downs use `issen timeline`'s **native typed query** (`--ip`, `--path`, `--first`, `--group-by`, `--distinct`, …) — one tool, no raw SQL.

> **Clock rule for every answer:** host clock is **UTC−7 = +1 h ahead** of the answer key's
> network clock (UTC−6). issen's `03:24:06Z` *is* the key's `02:24:06`. Same instant.

# Set Up in 60 Seconds

Before the hunt — get the tool and the evidence on disk. One-time, the only setup.

```bash
# 1 · Build issen (single static binary, no runtime deps)
git clone https://github.com/SecurityRonin/issen && cd issen
cargo build --release            # -> ./target/release/issen

# 2 · Grab Case 001 (DFIR Madness "Szechuan Sauce")
#     disk: DC01-E01.zip (~4.6 GB) · DESKTOP-E01.zip (~6.5 GB)
unzip DC01-memory.zip            # -> citadeldc01.mem (disk legs read the .zip as-is)

# 3 · First command — build the DC case
issen DC01-E01.zip -o dc01.duckdb
```

> **Need:** ~25 GB free for the extracted images + a few GB RAM for the memory walkers. issen reads **zip / 7z / tar.gz** directly — only the memory dump needs unzipping (it's a raw page stream).

---

# The One Command

`issen <evidence…>` **is** the pipeline: ingest -> memory -> correlate -> scan, one pass, one case DB.

```bash
issen DC01-E01.zip citadeldc01.mem -o case.duckdb   # disk + memory, everything
```

- No subcommands to sequence, no glue scripts — point it at the evidence, get findings.
- **Resumable: kill it, re-run it.** A re-run with the same evidence skips every completed stage and resumes where it stopped — a finished case re-runs in **0.1 s**. No fear of a crash mid-12 GB ingest.
- One DB, three views: `report --format text` (terminal narrative) · `report` (board HTML) · `report --format attack-navigator` (ATT&CK layer).

> The old dance — `ingest`, then `correlate`, then per-artifact queries — is now one re-runnable command.

---

# Speed Receipt — Measured, Not Promised

The whole Case-001 pipeline, release binary against the real images (2026-06-26):

| Stage | What | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest (2 × E01) | 2.34 M timeline events | **~7 min** (cold cache) |
| Memory (2 dumps) | EPROCESS / netstat / creds | **13 s** |
| Correlate | 9,381 cross-artifact findings | **3.7 min** |
| **Re-run** (resume) | every stage up-to-date | **0.1 s** |

> Measured on identical inputs on one machine — quoted verbatim. What a multi-tool workflow stitches together over hours of analyst time, the binary does in minutes of wall-clock — and gives the thinking time back.

---

# What to Expect While It Runs

A long ingest is **working, not stalled** — every stage narrates itself:

```text
> [1/4] Ingest - parse disk artifacts into the timeline     (~7 min)
  ok ingest (434.8s)
  ok memory (13.1s)
  (live spinner) correlate - cross-artifact rules ...
  ok correlate (222.9s)
Pipeline complete: 4 stage(s) ran, 0 skipped -> case.duckdb
```

- Each stage prints a banner + elapsed; ingest drives a live progress bar underneath.
- A re-run prints `0 ran, N skipped` — that's the resume path, near-instant.

# Group 2 · The Live System — `issen memory`

Everything the running box knew at capture: OS build, live processes, the C2 socket, injected code. One subcommand surface (`check / ps / netstat / scan`).

> Covers: **Q1–Q3 · Q6.1 · Q6.3 · Q6.7/6.8 · Q13** (+ DPAPI/provenance)

> 🛠️ **The hard way** — identify the kernel build, *download or build the Volatility 3 ISF symbol table* for it, let automagic pick a profile, then run `windows.pslist`, `windows.netscan`, `windows.malfind` as three separate plugins.

⚡ **The issen way** — `issen memory citadeldc01.mem --command all`: GUID-matches and pulls the PDB **inline**, then walks processes, the C2 socket, and injected regions in one pass.

---

# Q1–Q3 · Environment: OS, OS, local time

**Ground truth:** Server = **Windows Server 2012 R2 (build 9600)**; Desktop = **Windows 10 (19041)**; clock **mis-set to Pacific UTC−7** (network is Mountain UTC−6).

**Command** (issen resolves the kernel build to run the memory walkers):

```bash
issen memory "$DC_MEM" --command check     # symbol resolver matches the kernel PDB
issen memory "$WS_MEM" --command check
```

**Output** *(◐ — build is determined; named-value pull is WIP):*

```
DC  : kernel profile matched build 9600  → Server 2012 R2
WS  : kernel profile matched build 19041 → Windows 10
TimeZoneInformation = Pacific (UTC−7)   ← from SYSTEM hive (ingested)
```

**Make sense of it:** issen had to match the **exact kernel build** (9600 / 19041) to walk memory at all — so the OS falls out of that match. **Q3 is the trap:** the box says Pacific (UTC−7) but the network ran Mountain (UTC−6) — the +1 h skew you apply to every host timestamp. The clock *is* the lesson.

# Q6.1 · Which process was malicious?

**Ground truth:** `coreupdater.exe` (PID 3644).

PID   PPID  Process         State
3644  2244  coreupdater.ex  Exited
3724  452   spoolsv.exe     Running
```

**Make sense of it:** `coreupdater.exe` is the odd one out — a System32-looking name with no legitimate parent, **Exited** yet still holding a C2 socket (Q6.3). The conjunction with `spoolsv` is the migration story (Q6, below).

# Q6.3 · What IP is the malware calling? (C2)

**Ground truth:** `203.78.103.109:443` (Thailand).

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN — live RAM, no PCAP):*

```

**Make sense of it:** issen scans TCP endpoint pool tags and recovers an **ESTABLISHED** socket to **`203.78.103.109:443`** owned by **`coreupdater.exe` (3644)** — the C2, straight from memory **without the PCAP we excluded.** *Consistent with* an active command-and-control channel.

# Q6.7 / Q6.8 · Capabilities, and is it easily obtained?

**Ground truth:** Meterpreter / **Metasploit Framework** payload — injection, credential theft, keylogging, pivoting; and yes, **Metasploit is free and open-source**.

**Command** *(member evidence — full family ID is hash/YARA, ○):*

```bash
issen memory "$DC_MEM" --command scan     # injected RWX regions in spoolsv
```

**Output** *(◐ memory shows the behavior; family label is write-up/VT):*

```
spoolsv.exe (3724): private, executable region with PE header  →  consistent with injected payload
```

**Make sense of it:** issen's memory scan shows the **injection behavior**; the *family* name (Meterpreter) is **VT/hash + write-up** knowledge, conveyed as *"consistent with"* — never a definitive label. **Q6.8:** Metasploit is free and widely available — so its presence is **not** itself attribution.

# Q13 · When was the last known contact?

**Ground truth:** Adversary **still interactive at capture**; last interactive logoff ~03:00 (network); the migrated `spoolsv` session was resident in RAM.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type Logoff --last --show timestamp_display
issen memory "$DC_MEM" --command netstat     # C2 still ESTABLISHED at capture
```

**Output** *(◐ — logoff measured; session envelope needs correlation):*

latest Logoff: 2020-09-19T04:52:11.91Z
netstat: 203.78.103.109:443 still ESTABLISHED  → adversary live at acquisition
```

**Make sense of it:** the strongest "last contact" signal isn't a logoff — it's the **still-ESTABLISHED C2 in memory at capture**: the attacker was **live when the image was taken**. Pinning the exact final interactive second needs logon-session correlation (envelope of 4624↔4634); the *live C2* is the measured headline.

# Extra · Credentials infra + acquisition provenance

Two more a careful report notes:

- **DPAPI** — `Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI` logs + `BackUpKeySvc` artifacts are present on the image; the new **`dpapi-forensic`** crate decrypts the master keys / blobs behind saved credentials. ◐
- **Acquisition provenance** — `issen memory ps` shows **`FTK Imager.exe` running at capture**: proof of *how* the image was taken, and a reminder to exclude the responder's own footprint from the findings. ✅

> Provenance is a finding too — knowing the acquisition tool ran (and when) is part of a defensible chain of custody, and the deck's three-layer discipline applies to it as much as to the attack.

```

**Make sense of it:** **107 failures, then a Type-10 (RDP) success 2 s later**, same IP, as `Administrator`. *Consistent with* a successful RDP brute force (network **02:21:48**). The tool name ("Hydra") is write-up knowledge, **not** in the artifact — so we don't assert it.

# Q6.2 · Which IP delivered the payload?

**Make sense of it:** `194.61.24.102` is all over the **RDP connection/auth** events — it both **brute-forced and delivered** the payload over that session. The HTTP-download mechanism itself is PCAP-evidenced; the IP's role as the entry/source is **measured on disk**.

# Q8 · Did they access other systems? (how / when)

**Make sense of it:** the **two hosts and their /24** fall straight out of logon metadata + EVTX workstation names. The full interface table (DHCP/DNS/gateway) lives in the `SYSTEM` registry — value-extraction is WIP, so we report what's measured and flag the rest.

# B4 / B5 · Who actually logged on?

**Ground truth:** DC → `Administrator`; Desktop → `Administrator` + `Rick Sanchez`.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type LogonSuccess \
  --exclude-machine-accounts --distinct user
# (repeat on desktop.duckdb)
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
user
Administrator · mortysmith · ricksanchez       ← the humans
ANONYMOUS LOGON · SYSTEM · LOCAL/NETWORK SERVICE · DWM-1/2/3   ← Windows pseudo-accounts (filter)
```

**Make sense of it:** filter interactive/RDP logon types and drop machine (`$`) accounts → the **real humans**. On the DC only `Administrator`; the Desktop adds `ricksanchez` (and `mortysmith`). *Consistent with* the attacker reusing one privileged account across both hosts.

# Extra · How many times did they log in?

**Finding:** **4 distinct RDP sessions** over ~34 minutes — the logoff / re-login / re-migrate sequence (F25/F44).

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type LogonSuccess --ip 194.61.24.102 \

```
4 | 2020-09-19T03:21:48Z | 2020-09-19T03:56:04Z
```

**Make sense of it:** "the attacker logged in" hides that they did it **four times** — *consistent with* logging off (killing an un-migrated Meterpreter session) and re-establishing access. Session count is persistence-of-*access*, distinct from the malware's persistence.

# Extra · The outlier login (frequency analysis)

**Finding:** the rare-event technique (`issen frequency`, Events-Ripper posh600) flags `194.61.24.102` as a **statistical outlier** — no prior IOC needed.

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type LogonSuccess --group-by ip   # rare = outlier
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```

194.61.24.102    4    ← rare = the outlier
```

**Make sense of it:** you don't need the attacker's IP in advance — **rarity finds it.** An external source with a handful of logons stands out against the internal baseline. This is how you triage with zero starting indicators.

# Group 4 · File-System History — `issen timeline files` (MFT / USN)

What touched disk and when: the malware, the moves, the staged-and-deleted archives, the stolen files, the LNK trail.

> Covers: **Q6.4/6.5 · Q6.6 · Q8.3 · Q11 · Q12 · B7/B8** (+ LNK)

> 🛠️ **The hard way** — `MFTECmd`/`analyzeMFT` on `$MFT`, parse `$UsnJrnl` separately, then merge two CSVs and reconcile timestamps to rebuild the file's history.

⚡ **The issen way** — `issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*coreupdater*' --first`: MFT + USN already unified in the timeline; one glob, one answer.

---

# Q6.4 / Q6.5 · Where on disk, and when did it first appear?

**Ground truth:** `C:\Windows\System32\coreupdater.exe`, first seen 02:24:06 (network).

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*coreupdater*' --first \
  --show timestamp_display,artifact_path

```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
Windows/System32/coreupdater.exe
2020-09-19T03:24:06.44Z          (= network 02:24:06, exact match to the key)
```

**Make sense of it:** the MFT puts it in **System32** at host **03:24:06 = network 02:24:06** — matching the key to the second once the +1 h skew is applied.

# Q6.6 · Did someone move it?

**Ground truth:** Yes — downloaded to `Downloads`, then moved to `System32`.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*coreupdater*' --event-type FileRename \
  --show timestamp_display,source -n 4
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

2020-09-19T03:24:50.52Z | FileRename | UsnJournal
```

**Make sense of it:** the **USN journal** records **rename** operations seconds after the file first appeared — *consistent with* the download-then-relocate (`Downloads → System32`) that hides the binary among system files. USN catches the move even though the final MFT path only shows the destination.

```mermaid

# Q8.3 · Did they steal data, and when?

**Ground truth:** `secret.zip` (DC ~02:31) and `loot.zip` (Desktop ~02:47) staged, exfiltrated, then **deleted**.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline desktop.duckdb --path '*loot.zip*' \
  --show timestamp_display,event_type,source
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
2020-09-19T03:46:18.07Z | FileRename     | UsnJournal
2020-09-19T03:47:09.92Z | FileDelete     | UsnJournal
```

**Make sense of it:** the **USN journal** remembers `loot.zip` staged then **deleted at 03:47:09** — *after* the file is gone. Create-then-delete in a two-minute window is **consistent with** stage-exfil-cleanup. Bytes-on-wire is PCAP; the *staging act* is on disk.

# Q11 · Did they steal the Szechuan sauce? What time?

**Ground truth:** Yes — `Szechuan Sauce.txt` accessed ~02:32 (network), exfiltrated inside `secret.zip`.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*Szechuan*' --show timestamp_display,event_type
```

**Output** *(◐ — file trail measured; theft-window via secret.zip):*

```
… FileCreate / FileAccess / FileRename events for 'Szechuan Sauce.txt' (MFT) …
```

**Make sense of it:** issen recovers the file's **MFT access trail**; the *theft* is its presence in the `secret.zip` staging window (Q8.3, ~02:30–02:34 network). *Consistent with* exfiltration of the recipe. The exact handling sequence is an MFT/USN read — a member finding, not a one-line verdict.

```mermaid

# Q12 · Other sensitive files accessed?

**Ground truth:** **Beth's** secret (deleted, replaced, **timestomped** ~02:38) and **Morty's** files (~02:34).

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*beth*' --show timestamp_display,event_type
# then compare $SI vs $FN on the record — the timestomp tell
```

**Output** *(✅ trail measured; ◐ timestomp = analyst-confirmed lead):*

```
… FileRename / FileCreate / FileAccess / MetadataChange events for Beth's file (MFT) …
```

**Make sense of it:** issen recovers the full **create/replace/delete trail**; the **timestomp** is the `$SI`-earlier-than-`$FN` contradiction (the *Two Timestamps* card) — a **flagged lead**, *Info* severity, that the analyst confirms (the heuristic has false positives, so never auto-conclude).

```mermaid

# B7 / B8 · Recover Beth's file, and which was timestomped?

**Ground truth:** original `SECRET_beth.txt` ("Earth Beth is the real Beth."); the planted `Beth_Secret.txt` was **timestomped** to match `PortalGunPlans.txt`.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*beth*' --distinct artifact_path
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN — names recovered from MFT):*

```
SECRET_beth.txt   ← original (B7)        Beth_Secret.txt   ← planted / timestomped (B8)
SECRET_beth.lnk · Beth_Secret.lnk · PortalGunPlans.txt   (the timestamp donor)
```

**Make sense of it:** issen recovers the **filenames** straight from the MFT — the original `SECRET_beth.txt`, the planted `Beth_Secret.txt`, and `PortalGunPlans.txt` whose `$SI` times the attacker copied (**B8**). The **contents** of the original (B7's "Earth Beth…") need `$DATA`/slack **carving** — present in design, not this run (○). Names: ✅; contents: ○.

# Extra · What did they open? (LNK artifacts)

**Finding:** issen recovers **LNK** shortcuts — direct evidence of which sensitive files the attacker opened/staged.

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --path '*Szechuan*' --show timestamp_display,event_type
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
Secret.lnk · Szechuan Sauce.lnk · Beth_Secret.lnk · SECRET_beth.lnk
```

**Make sense of it:** an LNK exists because the file was **opened**. These corroborate the theft of the Szechuan recipe and Beth's secret **independently** of the MFT/USN trail — and `lnk-forensic` parses each target path + embedded timestamps for the full story.

# Group 5 · Persistence & Registry — `issen timeline persistence`

How it survives reboot, and the credential material — service, Run key, SAM hives. (`issen timeline persistence` / registry.)

> Covers: **Q6.9 · B6** (+ dual-persistence)

> 🛠️ **The hard way** — export the SYSTEM/SOFTWARE/SAM hives, run RegRipper for the Run key + services and `secretsdump.py` for the hashes — three tools, three outputs to reconcile.

⚡ **The issen way** — `issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type ServiceInstall --service coreupdater` (+ the `--source Registry` view): persistence and credential material already in the timeline.

---

# Q6.9 · Persistence — installed where, and when?

**Ground truth:** LocalSystem auto-start **service** `coreupdater` (7045) + Run key, **both hosts**, ~02:27:49.

**Command:**

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --event-type ServiceInstall --service coreupdater \
  --show timestamp_display,service
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
2020-09-19T03:27:49.50Z | coreupdater    (EventID 7045, Service Control Manager)
```

**Make sense of it:** a **7045 service-install** named `coreupdater` at network **02:27:49** — three minutes after the drop. *Consistent with* SYSTEM-level boot persistence. The Run-key copy is the same story from the registry hive.

```mermaid

# Extra · Dual persistence — Run key AND service

**Finding:** `coreupdater` is registered as a **7045 service** *and* a **Run key** — two independent IOCs.

```bash
issen timeline dc01.duckdb --source Registry --path '*coreupdater*' \
  --distinct artifact_path
```

**Output** *(MEASURED-BY-ISSEN):*

```
ControlSet001\Services\coreupdater   ← the service registered in the SYSTEM hive
```

**Make sense of it:** the official Q6.9 asks "persistence?" — singular. A thorough answer documents **both** mechanisms; remediation that removes only the service leaves the Run key, and it survives reboot.

# B6 · What are the domain passwords?

**Ground truth:** `Administrator` = `)&Denver89` (+ six more users in the key).

**Command** *(extract the hives; crack **offline** — not a live tool step):*

```bash
issen DC01-E01.zip -o dc01.duckdb  # SAM + SYSTEM hives extracted from the archive & ingested
# → carve SAM/SYSTEM → NTLM hashes → hashcat/john, offline in the lab
```

**Output** *(○ — out of the tool's reach by design):*

```
SAM + SYSTEM hives recovered from the image (registry events ingested).
NTLM extraction + cracking is a deliberate OFFLINE lab step — issen does not crack.
```

**Make sense of it:** issen *recovers the material* (the hives are in the image), but turning hashes into plaintext is **offline cracking** — rightly outside an evidence-handling tool. A forensic tool that emitted plaintext passwords would be doing the attacker's job; the **lab** owns this step.

# Group 6 · Attribution & Advisory

Where the tool stops and judgement begins: IP attribution (OSINT) and the controls that would have prevented it.

> Covers: **Q7 · Q10 · B1–B3**

> 🛠️ **The hard way** — manual VirusTotal / OSINT lookups on each IP, then hand-write the board brief and the control recommendations.

⚡ **The issen way** — issen supplies the *measured evidence* (IPs, roles, the chain); **attribution (OSINT) and advisory stay the analyst's judgement** — no tool shortcut, and we don't pretend otherwise.

---

# Q7 · What malicious IPs were involved?

**Ground truth:** `194.61.24.102` (entry/delivery) and `203.78.103.109` (C2). **7.1/7.2 — known infra / other attacks:** *no confirmed attribution.*

**Command:** the two IPs above (`Q5`/`Q6.2` logon metadata + `Q6.3` netstat).

**Output** *(✅ both IPs measured; ○ attribution):*

```
194.61.24.102  — RDP brute-force + delivery source   (measured)
203.78.103.109 — established C2 :443                  (measured)
7.1/7.2: known-adversary-infra association → OSINT, and RETRACTED by the lab author
```

**Make sense of it:** issen **measures both IPs and their roles**. Whether they belong to *known* adversary infrastructure is **OSINT, not a tool output** — and the once-cited `happydoghappycat-th.com` APT link was **retracted by the case author**, so we *do not* assert it. Absence of an OSINT hit proves nothing.

# Q10 · What architecture changes should be made now?

**Not a tool output — this is the analyst's recommendation layer.** issen supplies the *evidence*; you supply the *judgement*.

Grounded in what we measured:

- **RDP brute force succeeded** → restrict RDP (VPN/MFA/lockout), it was internet-reachable.
- **One credential pivoted DC → Desktop** → tier admin accounts; no shared local `Administrator`.
- **Persistence as a service** → service-creation (7045) alerting; app-allowlisting in System32.
- **C2 egress on :443** → egress filtering / inspection.

> This is **layer 3 of the epistemic stack** — recommendations, not findings. State them *as advice*, separate from the observed facts.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  EVID["measured findings"] --> J["analyst judgement"] --> REC["RDP MFA · tiered admin<br/>· 7045 alerting · egress filter"]

# B1–B3 · What would have prevented this?

**Not a tool output — the advisory layer.** issen gives the evidence; you map it to controls.

| # | Question | Grounded answer |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | CIS / SANS Controls | **CIS 4** secure config (no internet-facing RDP) · **CIS 5/6** account & access mgmt (MFA, no shared admin) · **CIS 8** audit logs · **CIS 13** network monitoring (egress) |
| B2 | Major architecture change | Put RDP behind a **VPN/MFA bastion**; the DC was reachable for a direct brute force |
| B3 | Policy / controls | Tiered admin (no one `Administrator` across hosts), account-lockout, service-creation (7045) alerting, egress filtering on `:443` |

> Tie each back to a **measured** finding (the 4625 brute force, the cross-host reuse, the 7045 install, the C2 egress) — recommendations earn their weight from evidence.

# What Issen Does NOT Do

Credibility comes from the boundary, stated plainly:

- **No password cracking** — it *recovers* the SAM/SYSTEM hives and NTLM material; turning hashes into plaintext is an **offline-lab** step (a forensic tool emitting plaintext would be doing the attacker's job).
- **No attribution / OSINT** — it measures IPs and their roles; whether they are *known* adversary infra is a VT/OSINT call (and the once-cited Case-001 APT link was **retracted** — absence of a hit proves nothing).
- **No PCAP** — deliberately excluded here; the C2 came from **memory**, not the wire.
- **Contents carving is WIP** — it recovers file *names* and the MFT trail; `$DATA`/slack **content** recovery is in design (o), not this run.

> Every answer is tagged: ✅ measured · ◐ partial · ○ out-of-tool-reach — never faked. The honesty *is* the credibility.

# The Takeaway

- The **mechanics** — containers, partition tables, NTFS, EVTX, registry, SRUM, memory — are **fundamentals you now recognize anywhere.**
- The **tooling** — one Rust-native fleet — collapses four ecosystems into one address space, so the friction stops stealing your thinking time.
- The **moat** — and your career — is the **mindset**: read the meaning, build the narrative, present with honesty.

**Now let's open the image.** → *Module 1: crack the container.*

# More From the Fleet · sqlite4n6

**The deleted rows are the evidence — and `sqlite3` can't see them.**

`sqlite-forensic` carves deleted records out of any SQLite database — browser history, chat apps, mobile artifacts — into a **review-ready spreadsheet**: live, prior-changed, and deleted versions recovered from the uncheckpointed WAL, the rollback journal, and free space. Opens evidence **read-only**, never re-surfaces a live row as "deleted."

```bash
sqlite4n6 carve History.db        # → History.recovered.xlsx
```

> **Coming next: mobile forensics.** Most phone evidence *is* SQLite — the next release turns `sqlite4n6` into first-class iOS / Android app-database recovery.

*The byte-layout diagrams in this deck come from its forensic paper.* · securityronin.github.io/sqlite-forensic
